# Project plan
The goal for this project is to build a travel blog. During our classes, we already built a list of friends. The blog could be similar, be creative! You can find our progress of the friends list in our [docs](https://github.com/hamburgcodingschool/javascript-for-web-2020-09).

## Project
You can use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or custom CSS for styling. In the end it is your project and you can do it how it is best for you! The following should give you a rough structure and idea of what to do. Most important thing is to be creative, explore and have fun!

Do not only make it work but make it beautiful :) This is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge, e.g. for employers! 

### A list of travel locations
* Build a list of locations you already travelled to
* The following information should be shown:
	* The Name of the city and country
	* When you were there, maybe a from and to date
	* A description what the purpose of the trip was, describe it a bit
	* Be creative, you can add as many information as you want!
* One should be able to remove travel locations
* This list should be read from and written to the local storage

### A form to add travel locations
* A user should be able to add travel locations with the needed information
* You can experiment with the various input elements, e.g. `<input type=“date” />` or `<textarea>`
* Make the name and the date of the travel location required. The description can be optional

### Show the current weather of the travel location
* We can fetch the current weather of the travel location using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Show it as one of the information in your travel location
* Dependent on the weather, you could show different icons

### Optional: Integrate your destinations on a map
So far, we have not played around with embedding a Google Map. If you want to, feel free to play around with the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and how to integrate it in your app.
